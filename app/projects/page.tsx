            Throughout my freelance career, I have independently designed and developed robust systems tailored to client needs, with a focus on multi-tenancy, real-time analytics, and seamless integrations. My projects range from complex asset management systems for hospitals to efficient e-commerce platforms and livestock management solutions. I prioritize creating user-centric platforms that optimize business operations, streamline workflows, and provide valuable data insights for decision-making. My tech stack includes PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, and integration with external APIs, ensuring reliable and scalable deployments for clients.
